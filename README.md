CopyPasteHelper
===============
Easily logs every cut and copy you perform on your computer. Only works 
with ctrl+c and ctrl+x meaning it won't work with menus and currently 
won't work on Macs.

Requirements
===============
Aside from Java in order for this to function you must also use 
JNativeHook.
